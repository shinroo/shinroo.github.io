		<h3 class="title">Skillset</h3>
		<p>I'm a generalist developer with mainly backend and data engineering experience. I've used many technologies and I believe that the choice of technology for a project depends on it's requirements and should not depend solely on the experience of the implementors. That being said, I do find it helpful to list some of my preferred technologies below to help illustrate what I've enjoyed using in the past:</p>

		<h3 class="title">Case Studies</h3>
		<p>Selected tasks I have worked on during my career</p>
		<hr>

		<h4 class="showcase-gap title">Setting up Google Analytics + Raspberry Pi Dashboard</h4>
		<h5 class="showcase-gap showcase-light ">System Administrator (Working Student) at HomeToGo in 2016</h5>

		<p>At my first ever job, I helped the marketing department of HomeToGo set up a custom dashboard which accessed
			Google Analytics data via a bash script on a Raspberry Pi. This was then connected to a large monitor in the
			marketing department's area. </p>

		<hr>

		<h4 class="showcase-gap title">SAP Leonardo ML - Google Cloud Platform integrations</h4>
		<h5 class="showcase-gap showcase-light ">Software Engineer (Working Student) at SAP Innovation Centre in 2017
		</h5>

		<p>My first professional software engineering task was working on a backend proxy service which would expose
			functionality from Google's cloud speech processiong APIs within SAP's Leonardo Machine Learning platform.
		</p>
		<p>I wrote the service in Python 3 using the Flask framework. This was deployed to an internal Cloud Foundry
			instance. The Flask application served a simple page which allowed the user to record their voice and have
			it be transcribed for them.</p>
		<p>This project was used by team management as part of the evaluation phase of a Google - SAP partnership, as
			described <a
				href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/08/google-announces-significant-partnership-with-sap-at-google-cloud-next-conference/?guccounter=1">here</a>.
		</p>

		<h4 class="showcase-gap title">I8n and UX improvement of CLI tool</h4>
		<h5 class="showcase-gap showcase-light ">Knowledge Manager (Working Student) at SAP Innovation Centre in 2018
		</h5>

		<p>Worked with UX specialist colleague to refactor SAP Leonardo ML CLI tool's build process to pull text sources
			(for labels and descriptions) from a single source. We did this by writing a python script to generate
			Golang CLI definitions (replacing static definitions) based on a JSON structure containing the text
			snippets.</p>
		<p>This improved the workflow for Knowledge Management staff responsible for in-application documentation and
			internationalisation by centralising the texts in one place and separating the concerns from the actual
			code.</p>

		<hr>

		<h4 class="showcase-gap title">Development of NRC Core Web Application</h4>
		<h5 class="showcase-gap showcase-light ">Software Engineer at Norwegian Refugee Council from
			2019 to 2021</h5>

		<p>Beneficiary identity, case and service management tool designed to make data collection easier and safer for
			the Norwegian Refugee Councils operations around the world.</p>
		<p>Involved in discovery phase, creating proof of concept applications on Salesforce, Anvil and Directus</p>
		<p>Full-stack Golang and JavaScript development on final open source implementation</p>
		<p>More information about this project can be found <a href="https://github.com/nrc-no/core">here</a>

		<hr>

		<h4 class="showcase-gap title">Web Scraping & Visualisation Project</h4>
		<h5 class="showcase-gap showcase-light ">Data Engineer at Deutsches Institut f√ºr Menschenrechte in 2020</h5>

		<p>Set up a data project end to end, including writing web scrapers (for bespoke websites and social media),
			performing NLP tasks (lemmatization, tokenization) and using an open source data visualisation tool to
			create dashboards (Metabase).</p>
		<p>Installed the PG_TRIGRAM PostgresSQL addon to be able to index text columns more efficiently thus speeding up
			the search functionalities on researcher's dashboard tools.</p>
		<p>The project was hosted on Digital Ocean's Kubernetes service.</p>

		<hr>

		<h4 class="showcase-gap title">Writing Data Ingestion Pipelines for Private Donation Data Warehouse</h4>
		<h5 class="showcase-gap showcase-light ">Backend/Data Engineer at Norwegian Refugee Council during
			2021</h5>

		<p>Implemented a series of proof of concept data pipelines to retrieve data from a variety of sources including: Google Analytics, Facebook ads, Typeform, Stripe and others.</p>
		<p>The proof of concept pipelines were developed as Python notebooks using the hosted notebooks feature in the Azure Machine Learning platform.</p>
		<p>Pipelines retrieved data from the various sources and then wrote the results to staging tables in Snowflake.</p>
		<p>A data analyst was trained on scheduling and working with the pipelines.</p>

		<hr>

		<h4 class="showcase-gap title">Leading a Team of Open-source Developers Working on Zula</h4>
		<h5 class="showcase-gap showcase-light ">Co-Founder at The Reading Tribe</h5>

		<p>Zula is on a mission to amplify diversity and inclusion in children's libraries and bookshelves around the
			globe!</p>
		<p>Web scraping, data engineering and full-stack web development (Go + React) and operations delivering an
			online children's library and publishing system, focussed on diversity.</p>
		<p>More information about this project can be found <a href="https://github.com/reading-tribe/zula">here</a></p>

		<hr>

		<h4 class="showcase-gap title">Implementation of Near Real-time Email Analysis API</h4>
		<h5 class="showcase-gap showcase-light ">Backend Platform Engineer at Mesg.ai</h5>

		<p>Worked with the CTO to implement a concurrent email analysis feature using Go that returned results in under 1ms when deployed to AWS lambda.</p>
		<p>Various NLP tasks would be run as Goroutines to be scheduled concurrently, including readability analysis, tokenization and other proprietary techniques.</p>
