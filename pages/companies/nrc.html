		<p>The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC, Norwegian: Flyktninghjelpen) is a humanitarian, non-governmental
			organisation that protects the rights of people affected by displacement. This includes refugees and
			internally displaced persons who are forced to flee their homes as a result of conflict, human rights
			violations and acute violence, as well as climate change and natural disasters.</p>
		<p>I spent just under 3 years at the Norwegian Refugee Council working as a member of the Digital Transformation
			team located in Berlin. The digital transformation team was created to spearhead NRC's strategic initiative
			to utilize technology to provide better services to refugees and internally displaced people areound the
			world. Reporting directly to the CIO of the NRC, the D-Team is the highest technical capacity in the
			organisation aiming to work on organisation-wide solutions.</p>

		<p>I held various roles at the organisation: I started as a freelance developer, before being brought on full
			time as a junior software developer. After 9 months I was promoted to the role of full-stack software
			developer. I eventually transitioned to a backend and data engineering focussed role.</p>

			usage in over 20 countries</h4>
		<h5 class="showcase-gap showcase-light ">Junior Software Developer, 2019</h5>

		<p>Took over as the sole developer on a Salesforce incident management tool, which aimed to provide a single
			source of truth for internal incidents within the organisation. The scope covered breaches of code of
			conduct, corruption, sexual exploitation and abuse, other crimes and disasters.</p>
		<p>This tool enabled staff to safely report incidents using a webform protected by the organisational SSO tool
			(Okta). Reports were fed into a custom-developed Salesforce data model via REST API. Dashboards and views
			were set up to enable members of appropriate teams to manage the incidents.</p>
		<p>I co-ordinated development with multiple stakeholders including protection from sexual exploitation and
			abuse, anti-corruption and health, safety and security teams. Their requirements were gathered and worked
			into a project backlog to be implemented in an agile manner.</p>
		<p>Scaled project from a pilot running in a single country to organisation-wide usage in all NRC regions
			worldwide over 2 days. Involved in hiring Salesforce administrator, who then took over the project.</p>

		<p>Worked with senior developer to repurpose progress made on another project to create a reusable tech stack
			for rapid applications development.</p>

			which read Directus collection definitions to generate forms and views, which were automatically integrated
			with the Directus REST API.</p>
		<p>When the COVID-19 pandemic began to seriously affect NRCs operations worldwide, the tech stack was used to
			set up a status reporting and visualisation tool which enabled managers in various regional, country and
			area offices to report the status of their operations with regards to COVID-19 restrictions. Upper
			management used the tool to inform decision making regarding various NRC programs.</p>
		<p>Involved in frontend development using Typescript and Angular as well as deployment and operations of the
			application on Kubernetes.</p>

			groups. Developed a consolidated data model combining various previous regional efforts.</p>

			needed for service delivery, while automating the reporting burden of area and country offices towards
			organisational verticals, donors and government agencies.</p>
		<p>Developed prototypes on various technology stacks to aid CIO in deciding on which stack to use. Encouraged
			selection of eventual tech stack based on React and Golang to deliver an inter source solution to encourage
			engagement from other technical teams in the organisation.</p>
